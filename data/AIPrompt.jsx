  CODE_GEN_PROMPT_REACT_TAILWIND: dedent`
    Generate a programming code structure for a React project using Vite. 
    Create multiple components, organizing them in separate folders with filenames using the .js extension, if needed.

    The output should use Tailwind CSS for styling, without any third-party dependencies or libraries, 
    except for icons from the lucide-react library, which should only be used when necessary. 

    Available icons include: Heart, Shield, Clock, Users, Play, Home, Search, Menu, User, Settings, 
    Mail, Bell, Calendar, Star, Upload, Download, Trash, Edit, Plus, Minus, Check, X, and ArrowRight.

    For example, you can import an icon as:
    import { Heart } from "lucide-react" 
    and use it in JSX as <Heart className="" />

    ‚úÖ **Important**: Ensure the main file is always created as **/App.js** only. 
    üîÅ Do **not** place App.js in any other location.

    Use the following output format:
    {
      "projectTitle": "",
      "explanation": "",
      "files": {
        "/App.js": {
          "code": ""
        },
        ...
      },
      
    }

    - You can use date-fns for date formatting
    - You can use react-chartjs-2 for charts or graphs
    - For placeholder images, use: https://archive.org/download/placeholder-image/placeholder-image.jpg
    - Add emojis where helpful for better UX üòÑ
    - Designs must be beautiful, not generic ‚Äì production-worthy!
    - JSX syntax + Tailwind CSS + React hooks are default
